                <ol>
                    <li>Mix Cassava dough with water and strain out the lumps.
                        (You can use a colander to make it easier)</li>
                    <li>Pour the mixture into a pot and add your corn dough to the mixture.</li>
                    <li>Add some more water and mix until the mixture is smooth and slightly thick.</li>
                    <li>Then add a teaspoon of salt to the mixture to taste</li>
                    <li>Place the pot on high heat until the mixture starts to boil.</li>
                    <li>Once it begins boiling use a spatula(Banku 'ta') 
                        to knead the mixture to prevent it from forming lumps.</li>
                    <li>Continue to knead the mixture intermittently until it gets 
                        smoother and thicker and its colour changes slightly.
                        <strong>Note:</strong> To know if your Banku is ready, 
                        you can mash a little of the cooked mixture in a little water.
                         If it dissolves and turns milky then your Banku isn't ready. 
                        You can as well taste it to check if its edible enough.</li>
                    <li>When the Banku is ready, dish it out with small balls and 
                        wrap each ball in a plain polythene rubber.</li>
                    <li>Keep them in an airtight container or food warmer. 
                        Banku can be kept for about two-three days without going bad, 
                        depending on how well it is preserved.</li>

                <ol>
                    <li>Wash chopped beef and cowhide and place in a saucepan, 
                        add a little water and bring to a boil. Pour in blended mix of onion, 
                        ginger and garlic and steam for about 10 mins.</li>
                    <li>Put chopped okro into another clean saucepan, 
                        add a cup of water and let it simmer for about 8 mins. 
                        Turn off the heat and allow it to cool.</li>
                    <li>Now pour some palm oil into another saucepan. 
                        Fry salted fish for a while, then add sliced onions. Cook for about 3 mins</li>
                    <li>Wash and chop tomatoes and add to the sauce.</li>
                    <li>Wash your herrings and take out the bones, 
                        add to the sauce and let it simmer for about 8 mins.</li>
                    <li>Now add your steamed beef, and cowhide (wele), stir and leave it for about
                        10 mins.</li>
                    <li>Finally, put in your cooked okro and stir to mix evenly, 
                        reduce the heat and allow it to cook for about 5 mins. 
                        Add some salt to your preferred taste( be careful though because momoni is naturally salty. 
                        make sure you taste the sauce before adding more salt)</li>
                        <p>Now Your banku and Okro stew is ready!</p>
